## Goal

- I’m a physician assistant with experience working with diverse patient populations. I’ve observed a recurring issue where patients are often unable to provide complete and accurate information about their past medical histories. This poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers in delivering optimal care. I understand how difficult it can be to keep track of so much health related information, especially those with complex medical histories featuring numerous diagnoses, medications, allergies, hospitalizations, specialists, etc. So to address this issue, I’m developing an app that simplifies the process of tracking and sharing one’s medical history with healthcare providers across all health networks. 

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to enter and store my complete medical history in one place, so that I can easily provide accurate information to my healthcare providers.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter and store the details of my entire care team, such as my PCP, OBGYN, optometrist, dentist, dermatologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist, etc.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter and store prior and upcoming appointments.
- As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, and delete entries.
- As a user, I want this app to be intuitive to use.
- As a user, I want to be able to use this app anywhere.
- As a user, I want to be able to use this app with screens of all sizes, including computers, tablets, and phones.
- As a user, I want to be able to share my data with my care team.
- As a user, I expect my private data to be protected.

## Stretch Goals

- I'd like to add in additional controllers, models, and pages, such as vitals, to be more comprehensive.
- I'd like to update the schemas to be more comprehensive.
- I'd like to have an emergency contact section where users authorize these individuals to have access to their medical histories.
- I'd like to have a section where users can upload important documentation, such as a living will or an advance directive.
- I'd like to have a feature that reminds users to take their medications.
- I'd like to have a feature that reminds users of their upcoming appointments.
- I'd like to have a feature that allows users to export their data in an easy to use form, such as a downloadable PDF.
- I'd ideally like to somehow store this data locally to eliminate the possibility of HIPPA violations.
